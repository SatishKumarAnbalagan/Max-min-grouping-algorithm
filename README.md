# Max-min-grouping-algorithm
Partial shading is a serious obstacle to effective utilization of photovoltaic (PV) systems since it can result in significant output power degradation for the system. A PV system is organized as a series connection of PV modules, each module comprising of a number of series-parallel connected cells. This dynamic programming algorithm persents a way to produce near-optimal reconfigurations of each PV module with the goal of maximizing the system output power level under any partial shading patterns. Through simulations, it has demonstrated up to a factor of 2.3X improvement in the output power level of a PV system comprised of 3 PV modules with 60 PV cells per module.

Dynamic programming algorithm finds grouping of array A with M groups so as to maximize the minimum element i.e. the summation of the elements in the j th group of array A. Grouping of the array A is described by an array G using optimal subproblem property
